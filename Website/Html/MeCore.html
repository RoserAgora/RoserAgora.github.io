  <h2 class="HuBenH2">Hu Tao</h2>
  <p class="teamp2">Hu Tao is described by most Genshin Impact characters as being a “prankster,” or is noted as causing mischief or trouble. Qiqi even describes Hu Tao as having a “punch-able face”, the reason Qiqi thinks Hu Tao is so punchable is because Hu Tao often tries to literally bury Qiqi. Remember, Qiqi is a zombie so it makes sense that our funeral director hero would try and bury Qiqi’s body for good.</p>

He is the one and only member of "Benny's Adventure Team," as everyone else left the team after experiencing the constant misfortune that follows him. Ironically enough Bennett is thought to be derived from the Latin name Benedictus which means “blessed.”</p>
